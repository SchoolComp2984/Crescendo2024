possibilities:
use of sensors to sense apriltags to move and adjust the robot into the right spot for whatever we're doing
use sensors to avoid collisions with other obstacles (robots, notes on ground)
maybe hard code three different variations depending on what spot we're in and set it up before the round starts
stages maybe - moving stage, shooting stage, etc
